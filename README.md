# Issue

AppleALC not work perfect, see AppleALC layout-id test results and find the suitable layout-id for you.Using USB Headphones maybe avoid this problem.

SDCardreader not work, if it's important to you, try to fix it use [Sinetek-rtsx](https://github.com/cholonam/Sinetek-rtsx).

Don't try to press FN + F11, this will cause the backlight of the screen to turn off.
