# Issue

AppleALC not work perfect, see AppleALC layout-id test results and find the suitable layout-id for you.(Use USB Headphones can avoid this problem)

SDCardreader not work, if it's important to you, try to fix it use [Sinetek-rtsx](https://github.com/cholonam/Sinetek-rtsx).

Don't try to press FN + F11. This will cause the backlight of the screen to turn off. I don't know how to fix this problem
